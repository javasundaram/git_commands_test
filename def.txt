Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods.

Data Preparation:

countplot
distplot
creation of new attributes
log transformation (applicant income, coapplicant income, loan amount, loan terms)

corelation matrix
drop unnecessary columns
label encoding
train-test split
model training

Easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models

Univariant Analysis
The distplot represents the univariate distribution of data i.e. data distribution of a variable against the density distribution. 
The seaborn. distplot() function accepts the data variable as an argument and returns the plot with the density distribution.
